# hurricane

The Hurricane tool allows to analyze the files of a system with their footprints. 

## Project organization

The project follows the git-flow model.

## Usage
The checkum command displays the footprints of the files in parameters : 

```
hurricane checksum <file1> [ <file2> [...]]
hurricane checksum ./test/checksum/*.test
```
The radar command can detect files located in a database thanks to its footprint (SHA256):

```
radare <database> <file1> [ <file2> [...]]
hurricane radare ./test/radar_database/db1.txt ./test/checksum/*.test
```
